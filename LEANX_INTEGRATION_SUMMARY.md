# Comprehensive Lean.x Payment Gateway Integration Guide

## 1. Context & Objective
The goal of this integration is to enable the **Canvas Builder** to process payments natively using the **Lean.x** gateway. Unlike standard integrations that redirect users to a generic payment landing page, this implementation uses the **"Silent Bill"** method. This allows the builder to:
1.  Fetch and display the bank list directly within the builder's UI (Checkout Modal).
2.  Allow the user to select their preferred bank (Maybank, CIMB, etc.).
3.  Redirect the user *directly* to that bank's login page, bypassing intermediate screens.

This provides a "White Label" feel for merchants using the platform.

## 2. Integration Architecture

### 2.1 Component Structure
The integration logic is primarily housed in `app.jsx`, distributed across two main components:
*   **`PaymentsPanel`**: Where the merchant inputs their API credentials (UUID, Auth Token). Handles validation and persistence.
*   **`CheckoutModal`**: The runtime component that fetches the bank list using the stored credentials and executes the payment transaction.

### 2.2 Data Persistence
Since this is a client-side builder application, we persist sensitive credentials in the browser's `localStorage`.
*   **Storage Key:** `leanx_settings`
*   **Data Structure:**
    ```json
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "mode": "live", // 'test' or 'live'
      "collectionUuid": "...",
      "authToken": "...",
      "hashKey": "..."
    }
    ```
*   **Security Implication:** In a pure frontend app, keys are exposed to the user. This is acceptable here because the *user* is the *merchant* configuring their own store. In a production consumer app, these requests should be proxied through a backend.

## 3. The "Auto-Detection" Bank Fetching Strategy (Core Logic)

### 3.1 The Problem: API Fragmentation & "Zero Active Banks"
During development, we discovered a significant fragmentation in the Lean.x API response structures:
1.  **B2C Accounts** (Model ID 1) return a flat array of banks.
2.  **B2B Accounts** (Model ID 2) return a deeply nested object structure.
3.  **Payment Types** (FPX/Web vs E-Wallet/Digital) are separate endpoints/flags.

If a merchant inputs valid credentials but queries the wrong "Model ID" (e.g., querying B2C when they are a B2B merchant), the API returns success (200 OK) but an empty bank list. This led to "0 Active Bank" errors despite valid keys.

### 3.2 The Solution: Parallel "Shotgun" Querying
Instead of forcing the merchant to select technical details (Model ID or Account Type), we implemented an intelligent **Auto-Detection System**.

When the Checkout Modal opens, the application simultaneously queries **4 distinct API combinations** using `Promise.all`:

| Request | Payment Type | Model ID | Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `WEB_PAYMENT` | `1` | FPX (Online Banking) for B2C |
| 2 | `WEB_PAYMENT` | `2` | FPX (Online Banking) for B2B |
| 3 | `DIGITAL_PAYMENT` | `1` | E-Wallets for B2C |
| 4 | `DIGITAL_PAYMENT` | `2` | E-Wallets for B2B |

### 3.3 Deep Parsing Logic (Code Deep Dive)
The most critical part of the integration is parsing the fragmented responses. We implemented a robust parser that can handle both standard and nested JSON shapes.

**The Code Implementation:**
```javascript
// Inside fetchBanks() in CheckoutModal

const combinations = [ /* The 4 combinations above */ ];

await Promise.all(combinations.map(async (combo) => {
    // 1. Fetch data
    const res = await fetch(apiUrl, { ... });
    const data = await res.json();
    
    // 2. Parser Logic
    let extracted = [];
    
    // CASE A: Standard/Flat Response (Common for B2C)
    if (Array.isArray(data.data)) {
        extracted = data.data; 
    }
    // CASE B: First-level Object Wrapper
    else if (data.data?.payment_services) {
        extracted = data.data.payment_services;
    }
    // CASE C: Deep Nested List (Common for B2B / Enterprise)
    // Structure: data.data.list.data[0].WEB_PAYMENT
    else if (data.data?.list?.data && Array.isArray(data.data.list.data)) {
        const firstItem = data.data.list.data[0];
        if (firstItem) {
            // Dynamically grab key based on request type
            if (combo.type === 'WEB_PAYMENT') extracted = firstItem.WEB_PAYMENT;
            else if (combo.type === 'DIGITAL_PAYMENT') extracted = firstItem.DIGITAL_PAYMENT;
        }
    }

    // 3. Normalization & UI Cleaning
    if (extracted.length > 0) {
        const tagged = extracted.map(b => ({
            payment_service_id: b.payment_service_id,
            // STRIP SUFFIX: Converts "Maybank2u B2B" -> "Maybank2u"
            payment_service_name: (b.name || b.payment_service_name).replace(/ B2B$/i, '').trim(),
            type: combo.type, 
            icon: combo.type === 'WEB_PAYMENT' ? 'ri-bank-line' : 'ri-wallet-3-line'
        }));
        allBanks = [...allBanks, ...tagged];
    }
}));
```

## 4. Transaction Flow: The "Silent Bill"

Once the user selects a bank, the application executes the transaction. This is a single-step process from the frontend perspective.

### 4.1 Request Payload
**Endpoint:** `POST https://api.leanx.io/api/v1/merchant/create-bill-silent`

**Payload Construction:**
```javascript
const payload = {
    "collection_uuid": leanxSettings.collectionUuid, // From Settings
    "payment_service_id": selectedBank.id,           // From User Selection
    "amount": product.price,                         // From Product Data
    "invoice_ref": `INV-${Date.now()}`,              // Auto-generated unique ID
    "full_name": formData.name,                      // From Checkout Form
    "email": formData.email,
    "phone_number": formData.phone,
    "redirect_url": window.location.href,            // Helper to return user here
    "callback_url": "..."                            // (Optional in this demo)
};
```

### 4.2 Handling the Redirect & Return (Verification Strategy)
The API responds with a `redirect_url` pointing to the Bank. We append `?payment_return=true` to our own return URL to detect when the user comes back.

**The "Fall-back" Verification Logic:**
Sometimes the redirect URL from the bank drops query parameters (like `status=1`). To ensure reliability, we implemented a 2-step check:

1.  **Step 1: URL Params:** Check for `status=1` or `status=SUCCESS` in the URL.
2.  **Step 2: Manual API Check (Fallback):** If URL params are missing, we use the `invoice_ref` (stored in localStorage before payment) to query the API directly.

```javascript
// POST https://api.leanx.io/api/v1/merchant/manual-checking-transaction?invoice_no=...
const res = await fetch(verifyUrl, { method: 'POST', ... });
if (data.data.transaction_details.invoice_status === 'SUCCESS') {
   // Mark as Success
}
```

## 5. Troubleshooting & Status Codes

### Common Issues Solved
1.  **Error: "0 Active Banks"**
    *   **Cause:** Auth Token is valid, but the requested channel (e.g., FPX B2C) is empty.
    *   **Fix:** Our Auto-Detect system solves this by trying *all* channels. If you still see this, the merchant account actually has 0 active banks in the Lean.x dashboard.

2.  **Error: "Validation Failed" (JSON)**
    *   **Cause:** `payment_model_reference_id` is missing or mismatched.
    *   **Fix:** We hardcode `model: 1` and `model: 2` in the parallel fetcher loops to ensure we hit the correct validation eventually.

3.  **UI Issue: Duplicate Banks**
    *   **Cause:** Sometimes "Maybank" appears in both B2C and B2B lists if a merchant has hybrid access.
    *   **Fix:** We deduplicate the final list based on `payment_service_id`.

## 6. Glossary of Lean.x Terminology
*   **WEB_PAYMENT:** Refers to FPX / Online Banking (Maybank2u, CIMB Clicks).
*   **DIGITAL_PAYMENT:** Refers to E-Wallets (TnG, GrabPay, Boost).
*   **Collection UUID:** A unique identifier for a specific "store" or revenue bucket within a Lead.x merchant account.
*   **Silent Bill:** A specific API mode where the payment page is skipped, and the URL provided points directly to the bank's login screen.
